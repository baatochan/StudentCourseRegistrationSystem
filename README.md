Authors: [Pawel Biel][Github pako535], Bartosz Rodziewicz

The app uses console UI (we tried doing GUI, but we failed - branch `pawel-frontend-gui`). Every usecase that was needed and modeled in UML is realized. Completed and working app is under tag `labC`.

This app also have few basic unit and acceptance tests (jUnit and FitNesse).

Files with `.bak` extension contains template backup of data needed for app to run.

Directory `LabE` contains java web app created for doing black-box tests with Solenium. Because of problems while crating it in IntelliJ (branch `baato-labE-black-box-testing`) we had to switch to Netbeans TTvTT We're still getting over from that experience. And we're sorry that we couldn't provide working one in IntelliJ for the next students.

Directory `Lab1` (and `baato-lab1` branch) contains simple app from lab1 task with basic UML model.

Directory `LabTasks` and `Reports` contains, obviously, lab tasks and reports. They are in Polish tho.

Directory `FitNesseRoot` contains FitNesse wiki with acceptance tests. However keep in mind that FitNesse auto generate a lot of files with long names that can cause a problem with git (We had to put our repo folder on `C:\` to make it work).
